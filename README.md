# Detecting_Object_Dimension_using_ArUco
A project for detecting an object and measuring its width and height with the help of ArUco Markers
Object detector is a module used for detecting the objects in homogeneous backgrounds.
An image is read and the object detector detects all the contours in the image to detect objects and aruco markers. The program calculates the pixel to cm ratio to calculate dimensions.
A 5x5 ID=10 ArUco marker is used here.
